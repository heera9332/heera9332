# [RoomsNearMe](https://roomsnearme.in/)

RoomsNearMe.in is a streamlined online platform designed to connect landlords and tenants with ease. As the founder and developer, I built this service with a focus on simplicity, speed, and user experience, allowing users to list rental rooms and find accommodations effortlessly.

- Developed using modern web technologies to ensure fast loading and responsiveness across all devices.
- Integrated a custom booking flow that enables real-time inquiries and smooth tenant-landlord communication.
- Created admin tools for landlords to manage room listings, view inquiries, and update availability.
- Focused on SEO optimization and minimal UI to improve discoverability and usability.
- Ongoing enhancements include user dashboard, progressive search filters, and map-based listings.

- **Technology Used:** ReactJS/NextJS, MongoDB
- **Live Preview:** [Room Near Me](https://roomsnearme.in)

This project reflects my ability to take an idea from concept to deploymentâ€”handling full-stack development, UI/UX design, and product scaling independently.
