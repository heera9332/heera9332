# The-Sight

The-Sight is a fully customizable therapy website built on Payload CMS. As the founder and lead developer, I designed the platform to empower therapists and clients with flexible content management, intuitive forms, and reliable email communications for scheduling and feedback.

- Built on Next.js 15 with the App Router for fast, SEO-friendly routing and dynamic page generation.
- Powered by Payload CMS to give non-technical users an easy interface for creating and organizing therapy content, blog posts, and resource pages.
- MongoDB–backed data layer for storing user profiles, session notes, form submissions, and content records.
- Customizable form builders for intake questionnaires, session feedback, and contact requests—complete with validation, conditional fields, and file uploads.
- Integrated email sending (via Nodemailer) for appointment confirmations, reminder notifications, and admin alerts.
- Responsive design using Tailwind CSS to ensure a consistent, accessible experience across desktop and mobile.

**Technology Used:** Next.js 15 (App Router), Payload CMS, MongoDB, Tailwind CSS, React, Node.js, Nodemailer

This project showcases end-to-end full-stack development—from content modeling in Payload CMS and dynamic form workflows to automated email delivery—allowing me to independently take a web application from concept through to scalable deployment.
